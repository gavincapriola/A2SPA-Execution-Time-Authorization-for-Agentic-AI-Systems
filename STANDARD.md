# A2SPA Standardization Path
## Toward a Common Execution-Time Authorization Control Plane

### Purpose
This document outlines a neutral path for positioning A2SPA concepts toward future standardization
without asserting endorsement, adoption, or governance.

### Scope
A2SPA defines execution-time authorization semantics applicable to agentic and autonomous systems
across industries and implementations.

### Compatibility
The A2SPA control plane is compatible with:
Existing transport security (TLS)
Identity and access management (IAM, OAuth, RBAC)
Agent orchestration frameworks
Workflow engines and schedulers

### Potential Standardization Tracks
A2SPA concepts may align with:
IETF informational RFCs
Industry working groups on AI safety and autonomy
Cloud-native security reference architectures
Agent interoperability initiatives

### Non-Assertion
This repository does not claim current standard status.
It provides a reference architecture intended to inform
future standards discussions around execution-time authorization.
